**Assistant:**
Nice! The Jekyll site scaffold is implemented, pages and responsive styles are added, and I verified it builds and serves locally at http://127.0.0.1:4001. My next step is to push the changes to your repo and/or help customize content (profile photo, project details)—tell me which you'd like me to do next.

**Assistant:**
Great! The new responsive, page-specific CSS is implemented and the site builds locally (one missing JS file warning only). My next step is to push these changes to the remote repo or continue refining styles—which would you like me to do?
