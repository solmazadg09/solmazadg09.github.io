This repository contains a simple, responsive personal site built with Jekyll.

## Features

- Jekyll site scaffold with three pages: Home, About, Projects
- Responsive CSS (no external frameworks)
- Clean, modular code structure with `_layouts`, `_includes`, and `assets`

## Run locally

Requirements: Ruby, Bundler

1. Install dependencies: `bundle install`
2. Serve locally: `bundle exec jekyll serve`
3. Open: `http://127.0.0.1:4000`

Replace the placeholder images in `assets/images` with your profile photo and project screenshots.

## Theme & customization

- The site supports a light and dark theme. Use the moon/sun button in the nav to toggle — your choice is saved in localStorage.
- Styles are in `assets/css/style.css`; replace colors or fonts there to match your brand.
- Add project screenshots in `assets/images/` and update `projects.md` with links and descriptions.
